# FMProductList

**FMProductList** is a SwiftUI application developed as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge, focusing on improving skills with **SwiftData** for managing dynamic product data. This project highlights modular view components, efficient state management, and responsive design for a clean and seamless user experience.

## Challenge Overview

This project was created as part of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge to:
- Develop a functional product list view with dynamic data.
- Implement a cart system where users can add or remove items.
- Ensure responsiveness and adaptability across different devices and screen sizes.
- Strengthen skills in data handling using **SwiftData** and state management in SwiftUI.

## Features

- **Product Display**: Browse a list of dessert items, dynamically generated from a data model.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to the cart, increasing and decreasing item quantities with ease.
- **State Management**: Reactivity is handled with SwiftUIâ€™s `@State` and `@Binding`, ensuring smooth UI updates as users interact with the app.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adjusts to various device sizes, ensuring a consistent and intuitive experience across iPhones and iPads.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular components like `ProductItemView` and `AddToCartButtonView` are designed for scalability and reuse throughout the app.

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: Built with SwiftUI for a declarative and reactive user interface, focusing on modularity and clean component design.
- **SwiftData**: Leveraged SwiftData for efficient data management, querying, and handling dynamic product data.
- **Icon Set Creator**: Used Icon Set Creator to generate the app icon for a polished, professional appearance.
- **npoint.io**: Hosted product data on npoint.io, allowing the app to fetch product information dynamically via API calls instead of relying on local storage.
